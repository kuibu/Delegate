# Delegate

Delegate is a Telegram-native public representative system for founders, advisors, creators, recruiters, and other inbound-heavy operators.

It is not a private assistant exposed to the public. Delegate is a separate public runtime that answers from approved public knowledge, routes sensitive work through explicit policy, charges for deeper access, and hands off to a human when the representative should not act alone.

The current product wedge is intentionally narrow:

- Telegram-first representative runtime
- public representative page and public-safe chat
- founder representative demo data
- FAQ, intake, paid continuation, and owner handoff
- governed compute through an isolated broker
- durable timers for approval expiration and handoff follow-up

## What Ships Today

Delegate currently includes these working surfaces and services:

- **Marketing site** in `apps/site`, using the Dispatch Editorial design system.
- **Public representative app** in `apps/reps`, including representative profiles, service tiers, Telegram deep links, and signed public-chat session state.
- **Owner dashboard** in `apps/web`, covering representative health, governed actions, compute sessions, artifacts, deliverables, packages, OpenViking traces, and workflow state.
- **Telegram bot runtime** in `apps/bot`, powered by grammY and shared runtime policy.
- **Compute broker** in `apps/compute-broker`, providing governed `exec`, `read`, `write`, `process`, and `browser` requests behind approval and policy gates.
- **Workflow runner** in `apps/workflow-runner`, supporting the local runner and Temporal-backed durable workflow dispatch.
- **Prisma/Postgres data model** for representatives, contacts, conversations, handoffs, approvals, invoices, compute, artifacts, deliverables, workflows, and audit trails.
- **OpenViking integration** for representative-scoped public resources, recall, session commit traces, and safe memory previews.
- **ClawHub registry primitives** for future non-privileged representative skill packs.

The two durable workflow kinds implemented today are:

- `APPROVAL_EXPIRATION`
- `HANDOFF_FOLLOW_UP`

Temporal is already wired for those workflows through post-commit command outbox dispatch, native workflow timers, cancellation cleanup, and dashboard phase observability. Ordinary real-time chat routing still stays out of Temporal.

## Architecture Principles

Delegate is built around a few hard boundaries:

- **Postgres is business truth.** Workflow, billing, handoff, approval, and dashboard state come from Postgres records.
- **Temporal is orchestration.** Temporal handles start, durable waiting, retry, wake-up, and cancellation delivery for long-running workflow timers.
- **Public representatives are not private workspaces.** The runtime does not read owner-private files, accounts, secrets, or hidden notes.
- **Compute is isolated and governed.** General-purpose commands and browser work go through the compute broker, capability policy, audit records, and owner-visible approvals.
- **Memory is scoped.** OpenViking stores representative-scoped public resources and public-safe long-term context, not owner-private state.
- **Policy beats prompt luck.** Sensitive actions pass through explicit `allow`, `ask`, or `deny` decisions instead of relying only on model behavior.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js and pnpm
- Docker, if you want the full local stack
- Provider API keys only when you want live model or OpenViking calls

Install dependencies and create local env:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the full Docker Compose stack:

```bash
pnpm docker:up
```

Run the standard checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Useful local URLs for the default Docker profile:

- Site: `http://localhost:3000`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard?view=overview`
- Representative: `http://localhost:3002/reps/lin-founder-rep`
- Compute broker health: `http://localhost:4010/health`
- Workflow runner health: `http://localhost:4020/health`
- Artifact store API: `http://localhost:9000`
- Artifact store console: `http://localhost:9001`
- OpenViking API: `http://localhost:1933`
- OpenViking console docs: `http://localhost:8020/docs`

If you are running the three Next.js apps manually side by side, use explicit ports:

```bash
PORT=3100 pnpm dev:site
PORT=3101 pnpm dev:dashboard
PORT=3102 pnpm dev:reps
```

Then open:

- Site: `http://localhost:3100`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3101/dashboard?view=overview`
- Representative: `http://localhost:3102/reps/lin-founder-rep`

For database-only local development:

```bash
pnpm docker:up:db
pnpm db:setup
pnpm dev:site
pnpm dev:dashboard
pnpm dev:reps
pnpm dev:bot
```

## Temporal Workflow Mode

Delegate defaults to the built-in local runner:

```bash
WORKFLOW_ENGINE=local_runner
```

In local-runner mode, due workflow rows are processed directly by `apps/workflow-runner`.

To run the Temporal profile:

```bash
pnpm docker:up:temporal
```

That profile starts Temporal, Temporal UI, namespace setup, and the workflow runner with Temporal settings. Once it is healthy, check:

- Temporal UI: `http://localhost:8233`
- Workflow runner: `http://localhost:4020/health`

The health response should report `engine: "temporal"` and a running Temporal bridge.

The current Temporal model is:

1. Producers write business truth, `WorkflowRun`, and `WorkflowCommandOutbox` in the same committed Postgres flow.
2. The workflow runner dispatches `START` and `CANCEL` commands after commit.
3. Temporal starts the workflow immediately with `externalWorkflowId` as the stable idempotency key.
4. The workflow receives `scheduledAt`, sleeps durably until that time, then runs a DB-backed idempotent activity.
5. Manual resolution updates Postgres first and treats Temporal cancellation as cleanup, not authority.

If Temporal configuration is incomplete, Delegate falls back to `local_runner` rather than enqueueing unserviceable Temporal jobs.

## Environment Guide

The default `.env.example` is safe for local development. Important settings:

- `DATABASE_URL` points Prisma to Postgres.
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`, and `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` enable the Telegram bot.
- `REP_PUBLIC_CHAT_SESSION_SECRET` can override the public-chat cookie signing secret. If unset, the reps app falls back to `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and then a local development secret.
- `DELEGATE_MODEL_ENABLED`, `DELEGATE_MODEL_PROVIDER`, `DELEGATE_OPENAI_MODEL`, and `DELEGATE_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` control model-backed representative replies.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `ARK_API_KEY` enable live provider calls.
- `OPENVIKING_*` controls public memory sync, recall, and commit behavior.
- `COMPUTE_*` controls the broker, Docker runner, browser image, and native computer-use readiness.
- `WORKFLOW_*` controls local-runner versus Temporal workflow execution.
- `ARTIFACT_STORE_*` controls MinIO-backed artifact storage.

When model providers are unavailable, the bot and public representative paths fall back to deterministic previews instead of failing the conversation.

## Useful Commands

```bash
pnpm dev:site
pnpm dev:dashboard
pnpm dev:reps
pnpm dev:bot
pnpm dev:compute-broker
pnpm dev:workflow-runner

pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:validate
pnpm db:migrate:dev
pnpm db:deploy
pnpm db:seed
pnpm db:setup

pnpm docker:ps
pnpm docker:logs
pnpm docker:down

pnpm registry:search:clawhub "qualification"
```

Telegram compute examples in a representative private chat:

```text
/compute pwd
/compute read README.md
/compute write notes/demo.txt ::: hello from delegate
/compute browser https://example.com
```

## Design System

Delegate uses the **Dispatch Editorial** direction from [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md):

- warm paper and parchment surfaces
- sea-ink and copper signal colors
- editorial marketing pages
- procedural, dense owner dashboard views
- trust disclosures close to primary actions

The project uses resilient local CSS font fallbacks during builds. If exact Instrument Sans, Instrument Serif, or IBM Plex Mono rendering is required later, self-host those font files instead of relying on build-time Google Fonts fetches.

## Current Boundaries

Delegate can:

- answer from public representative knowledge
- collect structured intake
- offer paid continuation
- create Telegram Stars invoices
- create owner handoff requests
- run governed compute and browser tasks through the broker
- persist artifacts, deliverables, package downloads, audit events, and ledgers
- expire approvals and follow up on handoffs through durable workflow timers

Delegate intentionally does not:

- expose owner-private workspace memory
- run arbitrary host commands from the representative runtime
- mutate real calendars or private accounts silently
- treat raw Temporal history as business truth
- migrate ordinary chat replies into long-running workflows
- trust client-supplied public-chat tier or recent-turn state as authority
