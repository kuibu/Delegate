# OpenViking Integration

## Purpose

Delegate uses OpenViking as a context database for Telegram public representatives.

It is used for:

- representative public resources
- representative-scoped audience memory
- representative-scoped agent patterns
- session recall and commit provenance

It is not used for:

- owner private notes
- owner private workspace state
- secrets or credentials
- billing truth
- handoff truth

Postgres remains the transactional source of truth. OpenViking is the context layer.

## Official OpenViking guidance we follow

Delegate follows the current OpenViking server-first model from the official docs and source:

- standalone HTTP service
- `Create -> Interact -> Commit` session lifecycle
- context types: `Resource`, `Memory`, `Skill`
- context layers: `L0`, `L1`, `L2`
- default recall pattern: `L1` first, `L2` only when needed
- OpenClaw Plugin 2.0 used as an architectural reference, not as a code import path

Official references:

- OpenViking README
- OpenViking API overview
- OpenViking configuration guide
- OpenViking deployment guide
- OpenViking session concept docs
- OpenViking context-layer docs
- OpenViking context-type docs

## Delegate-specific implementation choices

### Representative-scoped isolation

Delegate scopes OpenViking state by representative, contact, and Telegram chat.

- resources: `viking://resources/delegate/reps/{slug}/...`
- user memories: `viking://user/memories/.../delegate/{slug}/{contactId}/...`
- agent memories: `viking://agent/memories/.../delegate/{slug}/...`
- session key: `delegate:tg:{repSlug}:{chatId}:{contactId}`

This is stricter than a generic assistant integration because Delegate must never leak memory across representatives or audience members.

### Postgres provenance

Delegate writes recall traces and commit traces back into Postgres so the owner dashboard can show:

- what was recalled
- which URI it came from
- which layer was used
- the score
- when a session commit succeeded or failed

### Safe memory filter

Before writing anything to OpenViking, Delegate applies public-safety filtering.

Blocked content includes:

- passwords
- API keys
- credentials
- owner-private notes
- hidden admin context

### Graceful fallback

If OpenViking is down, or if the environment has no real model credentials, Delegate continues using deterministic policy behavior instead of crashing or broadening trust boundaries.

## Deviations from official defaults

### 1. Representative-scoped user identity

OpenViking itself supports account / user / agent scoping. Delegate additionally embeds representative slug and contact identity into URI layout and session keys.

Why:

- prevent cross-representative recall
- prevent cross-contact recall
- keep public-agent trust boundaries obvious and auditable

### 2. Postgres-backed observability

Official OpenViking usage does not require an external provenance table. Delegate adds:

- `ConversationRecallTrace`
- `ConversationCommitTrace`
- `RepresentativeContextSync`
- `OpenVikingMemoryRecord`

Why:

- owner dashboard needs visibility
- debugging trust-boundary issues needs durable provenance

### 3. Local Docker startup without real model credentials

For local Docker ergonomics, the OpenViking container renders a placeholder model API key when no real provider key is present so the service can boot and expose health/docs endpoints.

Delegate does not treat that as a valid credential set:

- dashboard health shows the API is reachable but model credentials are missing
- representative sync is blocked
- capture / recall / commit flows safely no-op

Why:

- keep Docker reproducible
- avoid fake-success memory writes
- preserve safe behavior until the operator provides `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ARK_API_KEY`

## Docker services

Local Compose services:

- `openviking` on `http://localhost:1933`
- `openviking-console` on `http://localhost:8020/docs`

The config template lives at:

- `deploy/openviking/ov.conf.example`

The runtime renders that template into:

- `/etc/openviking/ov.conf`

## Dashboard surface

Delegate exposes OpenViking controls in the dashboard:

- enable / disable per representative
- agent id override
- auto recall toggle
- auto capture toggle
- capture mode
- recall limit
- recall score threshold
- target URI root
- manual public knowledge sync
- health, sync status, sync error, sync counts
- recent recall traces
- recent commit traces
- safe memory preview

## Verification checklist

Expected local verification:

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm docker:up`
- `curl http://localhost:1933/health`
- `curl http://localhost:8020/health`
- `curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/openviking/health`

For real memory sync and recall, also set one of:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ARK_API_KEY`
