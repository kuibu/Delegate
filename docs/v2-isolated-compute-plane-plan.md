# V2 Isolated Compute Plane Plan

## Purpose

This document turns the `V2: Isolated Compute Plane` roadmap item into an engineering task list that can be executed inside the current Delegate monorepo.

It is intentionally narrower than the broader architecture decisions:

- V2 covers isolated general compute for `exec`, `read`, `write`, and `process`
- browser-heavy execution remains primarily a `V2.5` concern
- the public representative product boundary still applies

## Product goal

Let a Telegram public representative use general compute safely without:

- touching the owner's host machine
- silently running privileged actions
- bypassing billing
- mixing raw compute artifacts into public memory

The public-facing contract should remain understandable:

- this representative may run approved tasks in isolated environments
- some actions are automatic
- some actions require owner approval
- every action is auditable

## Non-goals for V2

- no full browser-first automation as a core dependency
- no direct host execution
- no arbitrary third-party plugin execution in the representative runtime
- no long-running workflow engine migration yet
- no multi-tenant remote compute marketplace yet

## Current repo anchors

This plan assumes the current repo structure:

- `apps/bot`: Telegram runtime
- `apps/web`: owner dashboard
- `packages/domain`: shared schema surface
- `packages/runtime`: action-gate and collector logic
- `packages/openviking`: memory and context client
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: transactional schema
- `compose.yml`: local stack definition

## Target system shape

## Service workstream

## 1. Compute broker service

### Responsibility

The broker is the only service allowed to touch the container runtime in local V2.

It should:

- accept signed internal execution requests
- resolve representative policy profile
- evaluate final capability rules
- create a compute lease
- launch the sandbox
- stream or poll execution result
- persist artifacts
- emit billing and audit records

### Internal API surface

Recommended endpoints:

- `POST /internal/compute/sessions`
- `POST /internal/compute/sessions/:id/executions`
- `POST /internal/compute/sessions/:id/heartbeat`
- `POST /internal/compute/sessions/:id/terminate`
- `GET /internal/compute/sessions/:id`
- `GET /internal/compute/sessions/:id/artifacts`

### Runtime model

In V2 local/dev:

- broker launches Docker containers directly
- only broker gets access to Docker socket
- public services do not get Docker access

In later prod:

- replace local Docker launch with a remote runner pool or Kubernetes job/controller

## 2. Sandbox runner image

Create a dedicated base image for compute sessions.

Contents:

- Node runtime
- minimal shell utilities
- locked-down filesystem layout
- writable workdir only under `/workspace`
- no owner secrets baked into image
- artifact uploader sidecar binary or lightweight client

V2 rule:

- no browser binaries required in the base image yet
- browser lane can come in V2.5

## 3. Session lease model

Every compute session should use:

- one lease token
- one sandbox
- one representative
- one contact
- one conversation

The lease should carry:

- allowed capabilities
- expiry
- max runtime
- artifact retention policy
- max cost ceiling

## Docker topology workstream

## Local compose changes

Add services:

- `compute-broker`
- `artifact-store`
- `artifact-store-init`

Recommended local topology:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    BOT["bot"] --> BROKER["compute-broker"]
    DASH["dashboard"] --> BROKER
    BROKER --> DOCKER["Docker Engine"]
    BROKER --> MINIO["artifact-store (MinIO)"]
    BROKER --> PG["postgres"]
```

### `compute-broker`

Requirements:

- internal-only port in compose network
- Docker socket mounted only here in local dev
- environment for object store credentials
- environment for default runner image

### `artifact-store`

Use MinIO in local dev.

Requirements:

- separate bucket for compute artifacts
- retention policy configuration
- no public anonymous reads

### `artifact-store-init`

Creates:

- bucket
- lifecycle policy
- least-privilege access key for broker

## Policy engine workstream

## Decision model

All compute actions go through:

1. representative default policy
2. capability-specific rules
3. path/command/domain matching
4. plan-tier and budget checks
5. contact trust tier
6. final result: `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`

## First V2 rule families

### Command rules

- block package managers by default
- block `sudo`, `docker`, `ssh`, `curl | sh`, and similar escalations
- allow a narrow starter set:
  - `ls`
  - `cat`
  - `rg`
  - `node`
  - `python`
  - project-local scripts under `/workspace`

### Path rules

- deny paths outside mounted workspace
- deny dotfiles containing secrets
- deny shell history
- deny mounted credentials

### Cost and duration rules

- auto-stop on runtime limit
- route to `ask` when predicted cost exceeds threshold
- route to `ask` when artifact egress exceeds threshold

### Trust rules

- public user cannot silently trigger high-cost compute
- owner-triggered actions may still hit `ask` for dangerous capability classes

## Approval UX

Dashboard requirements:

- pending approvals queue
- action summary
- command/path preview
- reason for policy escalation
- approve/reject with expiry

Bot requirements:

- representative can tell user when a task requires owner approval
- owner can receive approval request in inbox or dashboard

## Artifact storage workstream

## Storage design

Persist raw outputs outside Postgres.

Store:

- stdout/stderr text blobs
- generated files
- zip bundles
- structured JSON outputs
- traces

Do not store raw artifacts in OpenViking.

## Object key strategy

Recommended key layout:

```text
delegate/
  reps/{repSlug}/
    contacts/{contactId}/
      conversations/{conversationId}/
        sessions/{sessionId}/
          executions/{executionId}/
            {artifactKind}-{artifactId}
```

## Retention policy

V2 default:

- logs: 14 days
- generated files: 30 days
- owner-pinned artifacts: no auto-delete until unpinned

## Summarization path

After execution completes:

- raw artifact stays in object store
- broker creates short summary for dashboard
- only safe summary may be eligible for memory promotion later

## Billing hooks workstream

## Dual-ledger principle

Keep user-facing credits separate from internal cost accounting.

### User-facing debits

- `Compute Pass` consumption
- `Deep Help` compute allotment usage
- sponsor-pool consumption when configured

### Internal cost entries

- model usage during planning or summarization
- compute wall time
- CPU or memory overage if later needed
- artifact storage bytes
- artifact egress

## Hook points

Add billing hooks at:

- compute session created
- execution started
- execution completed
- artifact persisted
- session expired or terminated early

## V2 commercial rule

Before running non-trivial compute:

- verify plan entitlement or available credits
- if not enough credits:
  - offer `Compute Pass`
  - do not launch sandbox

## Dashboard workstream

Add a new dashboard lane after V2:

- `Compute`

The lane should show:

- active sessions
- recent executions
- pending approvals
- artifact list
- compute credit burn
- blocked actions and policy reasons

Representative setup should also gain:

- compute enabled toggle
- default base image selector
- max session minutes
- auto-approve budget
- artifact retention days
- path/domain policy editor

## Bot/runtime integration workstream

## New execution flow

1. user asks for a task that needs general compute
2. runtime classifies it as compute-capable
3. runtime creates a draft execution request
4. policy engine returns `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`
5. if `allow`, broker starts session and runs task
6. if `ask`, create approval request and notify owner
7. when done, runtime returns summary and optional artifact links
8. billing hooks and audit events are recorded

## Memory guardrails

V2 should not auto-promote raw compute output into OpenViking.

Only allow promotion of:

- short summaries
- durable user preferences learned from task completion
- representative-safe reusable patterns

Never promote:

- raw file contents
- secrets
- credential material
- owner-private business data from compute output

## Acceptance criteria

V2 is done when:

- a representative can run approved `exec/read/write/process` tasks in an isolated container
- no representative-triggered compute touches the host directly
- every execution has a policy decision, audit event, and billing record
- artifacts are stored outside Postgres and visible in dashboard
- approval-required tasks are blocked until owner action
- failed sessions clean up after themselves

## Task breakdown

## A. Schema and shared types

- add new enums and Prisma models
- add shared Zod schemas in `packages/domain` or `packages/compute-protocol`
- extend `EventAudit` event types
- add seeds for one representative with compute disabled by default

## B. Broker foundation

- scaffold `apps/compute-broker`
- implement lease creation
- implement Docker runner adapter
- implement heartbeat and termination
- add internal auth between bot/dashboard and broker

## C. Policy engine

- create `packages/capability-policy`
- implement rule matching
- add default policy packs
- add approval-request creation path

## D. Artifact layer

- add MinIO to compose
- add artifact bucket bootstrap
- implement artifact metadata persistence
- add retention metadata and cleanup job placeholder

## E. Billing hooks

- add ledger model and debit rules
- enforce entitlement checks before session start
- record internal usage on execution completion

## F. Dashboard

- add compute lane
- add approval queue
- add session/execution tables
- add artifact viewer/download links
- add compute policy editor in representative setup

## G. Bot integration

- add compute-intent path in runtime
- add execution summary responses
- add owner approval messaging
- add failure and timeout UX

## H. Verification

- unit tests for policy decisions
- integration test for broker session lifecycle
- integration test for artifact persistence
- integration test for approval gating
- regression test ensuring compute output does not auto-enter public memory

## Open questions

- do we want one reusable long-lived session per conversation, or strict one-task sessions in V2?
- do owner-triggered tasks share the same compute plane as public representative tasks, or need a separate owner-operator trust tier?
- should V2 support outbound network by default, or start with local-workspace-only mode?
- when a task creates multiple files, what is the default user-facing artifact packaging strategy?

## Suggested implementation phases

These phases are meant to be small enough for incremental delivery while still landing useful vertical slices.

### Phase A: Safe foundation

Goal:

- land the minimum data model and service skeleton needed to create isolated compute sessions without exposing them to end users yet

Includes:

- Prisma schema additions
- `packages/compute-protocol`
- `packages/capability-policy`
- `apps/compute-broker` skeleton
- Docker topology updates for `compute-broker` and `artifact-store`
- internal auth between bot/dashboard and broker
- broker health endpoints
- one default representative policy profile with compute disabled

Deliverable:

- a local stack where broker and artifact store boot successfully
- a broker integration test can create and terminate an empty compute session

Recommended ticket split:

1. schema migration
2. compute protocol package
3. capability policy package
4. compute broker app skeleton
5. compose updates

### Phase B: One vertical slice

Goal:

- ship one end-to-end compute capability with strong policy control

Recommended first slice:

- `exec` with a very narrow command allowlist

Includes:

- `allow / ask / deny` evaluation
- `ToolExecution` persistence
- one Docker runner adapter
- stdout/stderr artifact persistence
- billing ledger writes
- dashboard read-only compute lane
- bot/runtime path for one compute-capable intent

Deliverable:

- a representative can run one approved command in an isolated container
- blocked commands produce policy-driven responses
- approval-required commands create approval objects instead of executing

Recommended ticket split:

1. policy evaluation engine
2. Docker exec runner
3. artifact upload + metadata write
4. billing ledger hooks
5. dashboard session list
6. bot/runtime integration

### Phase C: Approval and operator control

Goal:

- turn compute from an internal feature into a governable owner feature

Includes:

- approval queue UI
- approval resolution API
- cost ceiling enforcement
- artifact viewer/download links
- representative-level compute settings
- policy rule editor
- audit event detail views

Deliverable:

- owner can approve or reject risky compute actions from dashboard
- representative clearly explains blocked vs pending vs completed compute tasks
- compute costs and outputs are visible to the owner

Recommended ticket split:

1. approval queue and status APIs
2. dashboard approvals panel
3. representative setup compute policy editor
4. cost ceiling and retention settings
5. audit and artifact detail views

### Phase D: Hardening

Goal:

- make the V2 compute plane reliable enough for real usage, not just demo flows

Includes:

- heartbeat expiry cleanup
- orphaned container cleanup
- artifact retention worker
- concurrency limits
- timeout enforcement
- regression suite for memory leakage and host isolation

Deliverable:

- failed or abandoned sessions clean themselves up
- broker survives retries and partial failures cleanly

## Recommended first milestone branch plan

If the team wants a practical branch-by-branch sequence, use:

1. `codex/v2-compute-schema-foundation`
2. `codex/v2-compute-broker-skeleton`
3. `codex/v2-compute-policy-engine`
4. `codex/v2-compute-artifacts-and-ledger`
5. `codex/v2-compute-dashboard-lane`
6. `codex/v2-compute-bot-integration`

That ordering keeps infra risk, product risk, and UI risk separated enough to review cleanly.
